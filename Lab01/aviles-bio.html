Hello! My name is Leonel Aviles, and I’m pursuing a degree in Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Cybersecurity here at Syracuse University. My main interest lies in understanding and strengthening the frameworks that make up our first line of defense against cyber attackers.

•	Strong foundation in risk management concepts
•	Proficiency in Python, SQL, and R

Beyond Work and School
Outside of academics and professional work, I enjoy staying active, whether that’s working out, being outdoors, or playing sports whenever I get the chance. I’m also a longtime Pokémon card collector, a hobby I’ve loved since childhood and watching anime.

I come from a large family of eight siblings, which has taught me that patience is key. Before starting my higher education, I served in the United States Marine Corps, an experience that shaped me into a disciplined, dedicated, and resilient individual.
