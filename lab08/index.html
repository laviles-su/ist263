        Hello! My name is <strong>Leonel Aviles</strong>, and I’m pursuing a degree in 
        Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Cybersecurity here at 
        Syracuse University. My main interest lies in understanding and strengthening the

    <p>
        Outside of academics and professional work, I enjoy staying active, whether that’s working 
        out, being outdoors, or playing sports whenever I get the chance. I’m also a longtime 
        Pokémon card collector, a hobby I’ve loved since childhood and watching anime.

    <p>
        I come from a large family of eight siblings, which has taught me that patience is key. 
        Before starting my higher education, I served in the <strong>United States Marine Corps</strong>, 
        an experience that shaped me into a disciplined, dedicated, and resilient individual.
